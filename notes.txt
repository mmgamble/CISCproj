//login page (GOT IT)
//takes you to main page after (GOT IT)

//Main page with 'choose your tournament' or 'make a new one'
//each link takes you to different tournament page
// links will use URL params to redirect, when making new, need to name it
//HOW I SHOULD DO THIS
//use URL parameters & render the body based off of the tournament, ask user if they want to join tournament first, if not already
//in it. They should enter tournament name and then be asked to join - nope just select tournament or create a new one.

//if going straight to tournament page, have to login

//tournament pages have:
//join tournament
//start game
//play game
//leaderboard on side/bracket (how will I do this?)
//show when lost/won & update
//back to tournament page link (stays logged in)


//add player to the certain game
//when entering game, display the game that the user is in, use if winner is not blank, the game will be over if the winner is decided
//once in designated game, play and put score into database, determine winner, log that into database
//then, duplicate the player into game 3 and repeat
//upon winner, close tournament for everyone and only display winner of the tournament


//need to set my winner, and if winner, the inside of the game will be the winner name. 
//then render new game!


//next, fix outputs (see phone screenshot)
//use CSS to format bracket
//fix bracket entries if/else
//how to end loop when bracket displayed

//need 3 different game functions: game 1, 2, 3
//this should eliminate race conditions
